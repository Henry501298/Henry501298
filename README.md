🎓Completed a B.B.A in Finance and Investments at Baruch College with a capstone in financial econometrics & Advance Corporate Finance. I have a strong background in understanding accounting principles from LaGuardia Community College where I have completed my A.S. in Accounting. Using skills I have developed in my accounting and finance courses such as understanding financial statement analysis & discounted cash flows I have been able to confidently conduct personal equity research for my portfolio. 

📖I have a growing passion for understanding data science for finance and applying those skills to make better-informed investment decisions for my personal portfolio using computational finance strategies with R programming. Skills I developed include multi-asset portfolio construction, optimization, and quantitative risk management. 

💡I aspire to become a financial planner/advisor or equity research analyst for an active portfolio management team and one day become a portfolio manager myself.
