Pursuing a B.B.A in Finance and Investments at Baruch College with a minor in financial technology I have a strong background in understanding accounting principles from LaGuardia Community College where I have completed my A.S. in Accounting. Using skills I have developed in my accounting and finance courses such as understanding fundamentals and financial statement analysis, discounted cash flows (DCFs) I have been able to confidently conduct personal equity research for my portfolio.

📖I have a growing passion for understanding data science for quantitative finance and applying those skills to make better-informed investment decisions for my personal portfolio using computational finance strategies with Python that I learned from Udemy courses I have completed. Skills I developed include calculating daily and annual returns, CAPM, Sharpe ratios of stocks and portfolios, portfolio optimization and allocation methods while understanding the importance of the Security Market Line, calculating betas and alphas of stocks.

💡I aspire to become a financial planner/advisor or equity research analyst for an active portfolio management team and one day become a portfolio manager myself.

🙏🏻My ultimate goal in life is to become a philanthropist, start up a not-for-profit financial services firm helping out low-income citizens & minorities of this great nation to help them reach their financial goals and to spread the importance of financial literacy.
